Neutron generator slow control software

NG_slowcontrol.py is the best version, rewritten in July 2015.
The old c script (slowcontrolops.c) had one too many features bolted on, whih caused it to overwrite a significant amount of data.

Operation:
The python script captures a small portion of the control interface window (the bit containing the slow control info).
It then selects the three bits that hold the numbers we want (temperature, voltage, current) and runs them through an ocr program.
These values are output (with unix timestamp) to SlowControl/NG_SC.txt
If the generator is running (both current and voltage nonzero), it runs with a period set by the minor_period variable for the time specified by the major_period variable.
If the generator is off (either current or voltage are zero) it returns.
For uninterrupted operation, set the script to run in cron with a period matching the major_period variable.
